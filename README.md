Arkham Horror LCG Chaos Bag
This is a web-based version of the Chaos Bag drawing element of the Arkham Horror Living Card Game (from Fantasy Flight Games).

There are a few of these out there, but none did what I liked the most about the mechanic - choosing a token from the chaos bag was your physical choice, not the product of something random outside of your control. You specifically select the token (albeit blind), so there is a part of you involved in the selection.

While other online chaos bags get you to press a button (or similar) to then be presented with a token at random, this version presents you with ALL the tokens in the bag, and invites you to select one to reveal it.

I started this shortly after the game came out, but soon was overwhelmed by all the different initial bags for different scenarios and different levels. I'd prefer a quick method for adding/removing tokens than selecting from a giant dropdown that has to be kept up-to-date with each new release.
